# ENGLISH AUCTION

This project demonstrates an advanced Hardhat use case, integrating other tools commonly used alongside Hardhat in the ecosystem.

The project comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. It also comes with a variety of other tools, preconfigured to work with the project code.

1. This contract is about English Auction. 
- A seller will create an auction with a starting price.
- Everyone who want to join have to bid more than starting price.
- An account have to bid more than the bid amount of previous one.
2. This contract is written in Solidity and test by Hardhat.
